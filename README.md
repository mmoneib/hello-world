Hello Everyone!

I started programming isnce I was a child doing work with Basic, an obscure programming environment called Toolbox, and my beloved Visual Basic 4.0. But that was some time ago. I started an imaginary company in my first year of college selling software for the Palm OS, but, again, that was some time ago. Ever since, I have been a professional Java developer with hands on experience in Python, Ruby, C++, C#, PL/SQL, and many other stuff.

When I am not writing code, I enjoy writing words, drawing faces or snakes and watches, and traveling around the world.

Here you can find some of my work, ideas, and dreams.
